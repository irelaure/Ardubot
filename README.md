#ARDUBOT#


### What is Ardubot? ###

Ardubot is the result of our desire of making Robot's coding achievable for kids. We want them to learn how it works and how itÂ´s created. That's why we have developed an educational ecosystem to enable kids to learn how to create technology projects with ease, where parents and teachers can also find the necessary tools to guide them through this exciting process.
